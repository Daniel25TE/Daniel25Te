# I'm a passionate software developer student at BYU-Idaho, and I will graduate in April 2026.
I'm currently working on different web projects, but the biggest one is the **"Maribao website"**, a project for a real company where people will be able to place reservations for the Maribao hotel located in Gral. Villamil Playas - Ecuador. My project is using HTML5, CSS3 (with some Tailwind), and modular JavaScript (Vanilla) for the frontend deployment and C#, Node.js, and Render for the backend and cloud services.

I invite you to take a look at my repositories!
