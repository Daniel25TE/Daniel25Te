# I'm a software developer student at BYU-Idaho, and I will graduate in April 2026.
I'm currently working on the **"Maribao website"**, a project for a real company where people will be able to place reservations for the Maribao hotel. My project will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend deployment and C#, .NET, and AWS for the backend and cloud services.

I will keep posting and updating you throughout this project.
